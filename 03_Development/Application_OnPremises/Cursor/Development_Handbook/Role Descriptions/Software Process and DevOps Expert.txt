Software Process and DevOps Expert (AI & Cross-Platform Trading Applications)


Role Overview

The Software Process and DevOps Expert defines, implements, and optimizes the complete software engineering lifecycle for AI-enabled, multi-platform trading applications.
This role ensures seamless delivery across iOS, Android, and Windows environments while maintaining strict quality, reliability, and compliance standards required for financial and algorithmic trading systems.

The expert drives process standardization, automation, and integration between AI model development, mobile frontends, and cloud or on-premise trading backends, enabling high-frequency, low-latency, and fault-tolerant software delivery.


Key Responsibilities:

 1) Software Process Design & Governance:

	- Define a unified SDLC that integrates mobile app development (Swift, Kotlin, .NET MAUI, React Native) with backend and AI components.

	- Maintain end-to-end workflows for requirements, implementation, testing, CI/CD, and release management.

	- Ensure process compliance with financial regulations, data security, and AI model governance standards.

	- Establish quality gates for each stage: build validation, test coverage, model verification, and trading strategy backtesting.

	- Own and evolve the project’s Development Handbook, workflow diagrams, and templates.

 2) DevOps Automation & Toolchain Integration:

	- Design, implement, and maintain multi-platform CI/CD pipelines for iOS (Xcode, Fastlane), Android (Gradle, Play Console), and Windows (MSBuild, App Center).

	- Automate build signing, provisioning, and artifact distribution for internal and public releases.

	- Integrate backend services and AI components into automated pipelines (Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, ONNX, or TensorFlow Serving).

	- Implement environment consistency and reproducibility (IaC with Terraform / Ansible / GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines).

	- Optimize build and test performance for low-latency, high-reliability trading systems.

 3) AI and Trading System Integration:

	- Define workflows for integrating AI model training, validation, and deployment into the CI/CD pipeline.

	- Automate data preprocessing, model retraining triggers, and performance evaluation before deployment.

	- Coordinate AI development with live trading environments, ensuring safe rollouts, A/B testing, and rollback mechanisms.

	- Align process and tooling with trading algorithm governance (traceability, auditability, and version control for model artifacts).

 4) Quality Assurance & Compliance:

	- Embed automated testing for:

	- Mobile UIs (Espresso, XCTest, Appium).

	- Backend APIs and trading logic (JUnit, pytest).

	- Model accuracy and drift detection.

	- Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools (SonarQube, ktlint, detekt, SwiftLint).

	- Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) and ensure compliance with data protection and financial audit requirements.

	- Establish traceability between requirements, code commits, AI models, and validation results.

 5) Infrastructure & Monitoring:

	- Manage CI/CD infrastructure for cloud and on-premise builds.

	- Automate deployment and monitoring of AI trading services, dashboards, and mobile apps.

	- Integrate logging, telemetry, and real-time health checks into build pipelines (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).

	- Implement rollback, hotfix, and failover strategies for trading-critical components.

 6) Continuous Improvement & Enablement:

	- Measure and report key DevOps metrics (build success, lead time, MTTR, coverage, latency).

	- Lead process retrospectives and improvement programs for both AI and app development teams.

	- Conduct workshops and coaching on CI/CD best practices, Git branching strategies, and test automation.

	- Champion a culture of data-driven decision making, reliability, and proactive quality ownership.
