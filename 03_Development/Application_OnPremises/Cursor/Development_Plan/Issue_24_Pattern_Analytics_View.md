## 📋 **Objective**

Expose pattern analytics to operators by listing learned patterns, displaying detailed metrics/visualizations, and providing management utilities to prune or filter patterns.

---

## 🎯 **Goals**

1. **Pattern Catalogue**: List and filter learned patterns with key performance metrics.
2. **Detailed Analytics**: Display confidence, success rates, associated indicators, and historical performance charts.
3. **Visualization & Filtering**: Provide charts/tables to analyze pattern efficacy across symbols/timeframes.
4. **Pattern Management**: Allow operators to archive/delete outdated patterns and refresh data from core-service.

## 📝 **Task Breakdown**

### **Task 1: Pattern List & Filters** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Implemented searchable/filterable list with success-rate slider, exchange/timeframe/status selectors, and badges for performance state.
- [x] Added inline indicators for profit factor, occurrences, and last updated.

### **Task 2: Pattern Detail View** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Detail panel renders KPI cards (success %, PF, avg PnL, drawdown) plus entry/exit criteria and indicator summaries.
- [x] Historical AreaChart mirrors success rate + profit factor trends leveraging Issue #22 chart components.

### **Task 3: Visualization & Insights** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Added performance-over-time chart and distribution breakdown (exchange share).
- [x] Hooked up toggles for status filtering (Top/Stable/Warning) to spotlight actionable patterns.

### **Task 4: Pattern Management Actions** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Archive/delete actions implemented with toast feedback; state updates propagate via service flow.
- [x] Manual refresh button re-subscribes to analytics feed.
- [x] Logged TODO for audit trail follow-up in Epic 6.

### **Task 5: Data Integration** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Defined `PatternAnalyticsService` abstraction + `StubPatternAnalyticsService` streaming summaries/detail + performance points.
- [x] ViewModel applies filters locally and lazy-loads details per selection; handles errors gracefully.

### **Task 6: Testing & Validation** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] `PatternAnalyticsViewModelTest` covers filtering, selection detail loading, and delete flow.
- [x] Manual QA with stub dataset verifying filters, charts, and management actions.

### **Task 7: Documentation & Workflow** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] Updated Dev Plan v6.1, `EPIC_5_STATUS.md` v1.7, Issue document, and UI handbook (pattern analytics section).
- [x] Followed workflow (unit tests → clean build → docs → CI w/ monitoring script).

### **Task 8: Build & Commit** [Status: ✅ COMPLETE]
- [x] `./gradlew :desktop-ui:test --no-daemon`
- [x] `./gradlew clean build --no-daemon`
- [x] Commit `feat(ui): add pattern analytics workspace (Issue #24)` (`54d6165`) pushed to `main`.
- [x] CI monitored via `check-ci-status.ps1 -Watch -WaitSeconds 20`.

## 📈 **Definition of Done**

- [x] Pattern analytics view & view model implemented with charts, filters, management actions.
- [x] Automated tests and manual QA completed with documented results.

## 💡 **Notes & Risks**

- Charting complexity may overlap with Issue #22—reuse components to reduce maintenance.
- Ensure analytics endpoints provide necessary data; coordinate with backend if additional aggregations required.
- Anticipate need for pagination/virtualization if dataset grows; design UI to accommodate future scalability.
