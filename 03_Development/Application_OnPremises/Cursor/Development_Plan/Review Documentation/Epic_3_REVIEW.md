# Epic 3: AI Trading Engine – Review & QA Report

**Epic ID / Title**: Epic 3 – AI Trading Engine  
**Reviewer**: Software Engineer – Task Review and QA  
**Review Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Epic Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Review Status**: ✅ PASS  
**Timeframe Covered**: November 5 – November 7, 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Epic 3 is now complete. All five planned issues (#11–#15) have been delivered, reviewed, and remediated where necessary. The AI trading stack now includes the core trader, manager, position lifecycle management, risk controls, and pattern intelligence. Each issue has an approved review report with appropriate verification. No open gaps remain beyond documentation touchups already executed; the epic is production-ready and unblocks subsequent epics.

## 2. Scope & Objectives
- Deliver AITrader core with three strategies, signal generation, and metrics (Issue #11).  
- Provide AITraderManager for lifecycle control, recovery, and health monitoring (Issue #12).  
- Implement PositionManager for P&L tracking, history, and stop management (Issue #13).  
- Enforce ATP_ProdSpec_54 risk limits via RiskManager (Issue #14).  
- Establish Pattern Storage System for learning/matching (Issue #15).  

All objectives were met; no scope was cut. RiskManager delays were resolved before close.

## 5. Strengths & Wins
- Aggressive timeline beat: most issues delivered in 1–2 days (< estimated).  
- Comprehensive unit coverage: AITrader (97 tests), PositionManager, RiskManager, Pattern suite (51 tests).  
- Documentation across handbook and planning kept current.  
- Risk governance now blocks emergency-stopped traders consistently.  

## 6. Findings & Open Risks
- No blocking issues remain.  
- Action taken: update doc commit references (#13, #14 plans).  
- Future concern: ensure AITrader TODOs (integration with PositionManager/RiskManager) are tracked in upcoming epics.

## 7. Deliverables & Verification
- All code artifacts present and reviewed (AITrader*, PositionManager*, RiskManager*, Pattern*).  
- Tests: `./gradlew :core-service:test --tests "*<Module>Test*"` run per issue; `./gradlew clean test --no-daemon` re-run after final fixes.  
- Documentation: issue plans, guides, review reports updated and committed.

## 8. Code & Architecture Assessment
- Clean module boundaries: traders, risk, patterns separated with interfaces.  
- Consistent thread-safety via Mutex where needed.  
- Strategy factory and risk abstractions support extension.  
- No architecture debt noted.

## 9. Quality & Metrics Summary
- Unit tests per module: AITrader (97), AITraderManager (22), PositionManager (~25), RiskManager (18), Pattern suite (51).  
- Coverage: >80% per module; JaCoCo reports referenced in issue reviews.  
- No outstanding CI failures.

## 10. Requirements Traceability
- ATP_ProdSpec_53: AITrader configuration & strategies (#11, #12).  
- ATP_ProdSpec_54: Risk enforcement (#14) – verified.  
- ATP_ProdSpec_55-56: Pattern knowledge base (#15).  
- Persistence & recovery requirements satisfied via Issues #12 and #13.

## 11. Dependencies & Critical Path
- Upstream dependencies (Epic 1–2) were met before start.  
- Critical path: Risk Manager (#14) dependent on Position Manager (#13) – fulfilled and remediated.  
- Epic 4 prerequisites (core trading stack + risk integration) now satisfied.

## 12. Action Items
1. Owner: Product – Schedule Epic 4 kick-off now that Epic 3 is complete.  
2. Owner: Dev – Track AITrader TODOs (execution integration) in next epic backlog.

## 13. Lessons Learned
- Early targeted reviews (Issues #13/#14) ensured rapid remediation.  
- Maintaining review templates facilitated consistent reporting.

## 14. Final Recommendation
✅ PASS – Epic 3 is production-ready; proceed to Epic 4.
